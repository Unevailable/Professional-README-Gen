## Installation
firstly I copied the starter code, after that I added the npm inquirer package next I added a .gitignore and .DS.Store, after setting it all up I started working on the index and generate js to make the program work as intended, lastly, I created the repo, cloned it to my PC, and moved all the code into that repo.

## Usage
to use it you want to head to the directory of the file and in git bash or cmd prompt you type node index.js to start the program. It will give you prompts for you to input an answer for example "What is the title?" you would input the title of your project and hit enter that input will be placed into the read me file.

## Contributing
I used Xpert Learning Assistant to help check for errors in my code other than that there were no other contributors.

## Tests
The project results showed a working program that generated a proper README file.
